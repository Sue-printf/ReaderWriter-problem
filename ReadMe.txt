Guidelines on running the Java program
* To run the Java program, ensure that you have the latest JDK installed on your PC.

* Go to the command prompt, and use the command cd to take you to where the java file is. For example, if it is in the Downloads folder, you should use the following command: cd Downloads

* Compile your Java file by using the following command prompt: javac ReaderWriter.java

* This will generate a file named ReaderWriter.class in the same directory. 

* After compiling, you can run your program with: java ReaderWriter 5, or any number between 1 to 12.
 
* You should get an output that looks like this: Executing... please wait...
Writer Done!
I'm reader1, counter = 25000
I'm reader3, counter = 25000
I'm reader5, counter = 25000
I'm reader2, counter = 25000
I'm reader4, counter = 25000

* The above output meets the expected requirements.


Additional Information

* I have also written a C program.

* If you are using Windows, download and install Cygwin from its main website and ensure all packages with gcc are installed during the installation process.

* Kindly run the C file first and test it out. If it is correct and meets the requirements, you may use it.

* After successful installation, use the Cygwin terminal to run the counter.c code.

* Use the following commands to run the code: 

  * cd /cygdrive/c/Users/yourpcname/Desktop - This will help you navigate to the file directory.

  * gcc n_readers_1_writer.c -o a - This will compile the n_readers_1_writer.c code, creating an a.exe file in the same directory. The "a" letter after "-o" can be substituted with any letter of your choice.

  * ./a 6 - You can input any number between 1 to 12. This should run the code.

* You should get an output that looks like this: Executing... please wait...
